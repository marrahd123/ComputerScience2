# Doubly-Linked List

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to implement a doubly-linked list.

## Evaluation
Students will be awarded up to 10 points for successfully completing this lab as
outlined below.

## Step 1 Getting Started
Clone this repository. Study the starter code. Note that each DoubleNode has two
refenereces: one to the node before and one to the node after.

## Step 2 Implement the Mutators in the DoubleList class
All accessors are provided. You will need to implement the following mutators:
* ```addToFront(T element)``` Add a new node containing element to the head
of the list. Update the node count.
* ```addToRear(T element)``` Add a new node containing element to the end of
the list. Update the node count.
* ```addAfter(T target, T element)``` Add a new node after the node
containing target.The new node should contain element.Update the node count.
There is additional instruction in the next lab step.
* ```removeFirst()``` Remove the first node from the list and return the
element it contained. Update the node count. Throw a
```EmptyCollectionException``` if the list is empty.
* ```removeLast()``` Remove the last node from the list and return the
element it contained. Update the node count.Throw a
```EmptyCollectionException``` if the list is empty.
* ```remove(T element)``` Remove the node containing element from the list
and return the element it contained. Update the node count. Throw a
```EmptyCollectionException``` if the list is empty. Throw a
[```NoSuchElementException```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/NoSuchElementException.html)
if the element can not be found in the list.


Important: Handwrite your method and test it with a partner before including it
in the LinkedList class. When you are convinced it works, write it in your
DoubleList class. Obtain your partnerâ€™s signature on your paper.
